<h2>Criminal matters</h2>
<p>In the case of a criminal offence, the alleged offender is arrested and taken to a police station where the charge is explained and a formal written charge is made.
The alternative is that the accused is summonsed by police to attend court to answer the charge or charges.
Usually, the arrested person is released on bail, which is an undertaking/agreement to attend court on a certain day at a given time. For the most serious offences, the arrested person may be kept in custody.
For less serious offences, rather than arrest, the charging officer can exercise discretion and commence the action by prosecution notice accompanied with either a court hearing notice or summons.
The alleged offender receives a document requiring his or her attendance at court, which also provides information as to the alleged offence.
A date is set for the court attendance and the accused person will be requested to plead ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’.
If a person needs legal help before being able to plead, the case is adjourned to a later date.
If the accused pleads guilty, the magistrate will deal with the matter. If the plea is not guilty, a trial date is set and trial preparations begin.
